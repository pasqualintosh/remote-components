For privacy reasons only those who are at least 18 years old can create an account and start playing.","id_12_05":"Well, how does it work?","id_12_06":"MUV allows you to track sustainable trips and challenge yourself in various game modes.\nPressing the PLAY button and choosing your preferred transit mode (walking, cycling, public transport or carpooling) the tracking phase will start. During this phase you will earn points based on the distance travelled and the means of transport chosen. If you have changed means of transport by pressing the PAUSE button you can switch to another mode.","id_12_07":"What exactly are frequent trips?","id_12_08":"These are the trips you travel daily or several days a week, such as your home-work route. These trips contribute to most of your CO2 emissions, even a small improvement in your mobility habits can produce a significant positive impact for your city.","id_12_09":"Why is it important to add frequent trips?","id_12_10":"For us it's essential to know all of your routinely traveling because, by analysing such trips, we are able to evaluate your impact in terms of CO2 reductions as well as to estimate the improvement of your sustainable behaviours.","id_12_11":"How is personal data handled?","id_12_12":"All personal data you provide us with is stored, managed and processed in accordance with the GDPR, the EU regulation for the protection of personal data of European citizens. For more information, please refer to our Privacy Policy (https://www.muvgame.com/privacy_policy.html).","id_12_13":"How do Challenges work?","id_12_14":"Challenges are launched from time to time among the users of the community and offer prizes and discounts, provided by MUV sponsors, to the winners. Each Challenge has its own regulation, which is explained in a dedicated page, and has a specific lifespan that makes it disappear as soon as it expires. Neither Apple nor Google are sponsors of Challenges.","id_12_15":"How do I join a Challenge?","id_12_16":"You receive a notification when a new Challenge is available. You can enroll by selecting it and then join it. By joining, you confirm that you accept the rules of the challenge. Then, the Challenge will be added to the ACCEPTED CHALLENGES section and you'll be officially on board.","id_12_17":"How can I redeem my Rewards?","id_12_18":"Every time you complete a Challenge, you get the reward mentioned. You will find it in the REWARDS section; to redeem it, follow the instructions on the given card. Each reward has a validity date after which it is no longer possible to redeem it, however, it will remain in the app even after its expiration.","id_12_19":"Why does the app often stop working while it's in the background and I'm tracking a trip? I use an Android Huawei/Honor phone.","id_12_20":"Traditionally Huawei has a problem with managing background processes and this often leads to killings of apps working in background. To solve the problem you need to follow these steps: \nPhone settings > Battery > App launch and then set MUV to 'Manage manually\" and make sure everything is turned on.","id_12_21":"Why does the app often stop working while it's in the background and I'm tracking a trip? I use an Android OnePlus phone.","id_12_22":"OnePlus recently introduced one of the most severe background limits on Android devices. Not only users need to enable extra settings to make their apps work properly, but those settings even get randomly reset so users are required to re-enable them on a regular basis. To solve the problem you need to follow these steps: \nOpen the OnePlus multitasking menu, then select the icon at the top right of MUV; as soon as the window opens, select the LOCK option.","id_12_23":"Why does the app often stop working while it's in the background and I'm tracking a trip? I use an Android Nokia phone.","id_12_24":"Although most of the problems related to stopping background apps were solved in March 2019, some Nokia phones still kill any background process after 20 minutes if the screen is off.\nTo fix this issue, please do the following:\n- Go to Phone settings > Apps > See all apps\n- Tap on the right top corner menu > Show system\n- Find > Power saver app in the list, select it and Force close. It will remain stopped for a while, but will restart itself eventually.","id_12_25":"Why the app, after having tracked me, didn't give me any points at the end of the route? I use an iPhone.","id_12_26":"This problem could be due to the non-enabling of 'Motion & Fitness\" tracking. Solving it is easy:\nGo to Settings > Privacy > Motion & Fitness, then enable the \"Fitness tracking\" (if necessary) and do the same for MUV.","id_12_27":"Why was my walking trip not considered valid?","id_12_28":"It's actually quite unusual, try checking if you've enabled location services in particular:\nGo to Settings > Privacy > Location Services, scroll down to find MUV and then tap the app and select the option 'While Using the App\" or \"Always\".","id_12_29":"Why was my trip by bicycle not considered valid?","id_12_30":"The problem may be due to the high speed you have reached. In this case the activity recognition algorithm may have considered you as 'in vehicle\" even if you were not. To receive additional support, please send us feedback from the dedicated button within the trip summary feed card.","id_12_31":"Why was my trip on public transport not considered valid?","id_12_32":"The error in validating the trip (unless you cheated) is due to the fact that the GPS point measurements have not found a match with a trip in the OpenStreetMap public transport database that we use as a reference. This can be due to several reasons: lack of coverage or weak GPS signal, poor GPS accuracy of the phone, errors due to lack of lines or stops in a given city. At the moment, we are working on a new algorithm that aims to be faster and more accurate; in the meantime, if you want to help us, report the trip from the dedicated button within the trip summary feed card to let us analyse your use case.","id_12_33":"Why was my carpooling trip not considered valid?","id_12_34":"","id_12_35":"How did I get far fewer points than I usually get when I do the same trip?","id_12_36":"There are two main reasons for this:\n1. MUV trips are validated segment by segment and then, when you press STOP, with a final validation process. If it finds inaccuracies or conflicting data then it may not consider some segments valid and thus reduce the total number of points awarded for the trip.\n2. Each user has a certain number of ideal kms to cover in a sustainable way every day for each transit mode. When this threshold is reached, the point conversion algorithm becomes less rewarding. If you have already done several trips today, it is possible that you already reached this level.","id_12_37":"Why was my home-to-work trip not recognized as a frequent one?","id_12_38":"If the trip has been validated but not marked as home-work, this is probably due to one of the following reasons:\n1. You pressed PLAY when you were too far away from home or work.\n2. You pressed STOP when you were not yet close enough to work or home.\n3. You made inaccuracies when you uploaded your routinary home-work trip.\nIn the latter case you can go to the 'Frequent trips\" section of the side menu and eventually edit the starting and ending point of your frequent trip.","id_12_39":"Top Questions","id_12_40":"MUV general features","id_12_41":"MUV Game Dynamics","id_12_42":"Solving Common Problems","id_12_43":"FAQ & Tutorials","id_12_44":"How can we help you?","id_12_45":"Discover more about MUV through our tutorials","id_13_03":"Personal data","id_13_04":"Complete your profile.","id_13_05":"Account","id_13_06":"Change your nickname, password or GDPR options.","id_13_07":"Notifications","id_13_08":"Activate push notifications to be more competitive.","id_13_09":"Language","id_13_10":"Change MUV language.","id_13_13":"Version","id_13_14":"Date of birth","id_13_15":"So we can wish you a happy birthday!","id_13_16":"Gender","id_13_17":"This will improve the accuracy in calculating calories.","id_13_18":"Height","id_13_19":"Weight","id_13_20":"Male","id_13_21":"Female","id_13_22":"Prefer not to say","id_13_23":"Confirm","id_13_24":"Change password","id_13_25":"Security is never too high.","id_13_26":"Informed consent","id_13_27":"Aka all the GDPR stuff.","id_13_28":"Delete your profile","id_13_29":"Why would you ever want to do that?","id_13_30":"Current password","id_13_31":"New password","id_13_32":"Confirm password","id_13_33":"We hope it's just a goodbye","id_13_34":"Are you sure you want to delete your profile?","id_13_35":"The action is irreversible and all your data will be removed.","id_13_36":"Yes, delete me.","id_13_61":"Terms and Conditions","id_13_62":"How the MUV service works.","id_13_63":"Privacy Policy","id_13_64":"How we handle your data.","id_13_75":"Change nickname","id_13_76":"Edit your nickname checking it is available (and not offensive), then click Confirm.","id_13_77":"Give your avatar a new name.","id_13_37":"Italian","id_13_38":"English","id_13_65":"Spanish","id_13_66":"Portoguese","id_13_39":"Change language","id_13_40":"The app will restart.","id_13_41":"Morning start","id_13_42":"Tired of getting out and forgetting to start MUV?

Durante questa fase guadagnerai punti in base alla distanza percorsa e al mezzo di trasporto scelto. Se hai cambiato mezzo di trasporto, premendo il pulsante PAUSA puoi passare a un'altra modalità.","id_12_07":"Cosa sono di preciso i tragitti frequenti?","id_12_08":"Sono le tratte che percorri quotidinamente o diversi giorni a settimana, come ad esempio la tratta casa-lavoro.

Ogni Sfida ha il proprio regolamento, che è spiegato in una pagina dedicata, e ha una durata specifica che la fa scomparire non appena scade.

La troverai nella sezione RICOMPENSE; per riscattarla, segui le istruzioni sulla card ricevuta. Ogni ricompensa ha una validità limitata dopo la quale non è più possibile riscuoterla, in ogni caso rimarrà nell'app fino alla sua scadenza.","id_12_19":"Perché spesso l'app smette di funzionare mentre è in background e sto registrando una tratta? Uso un telefono Android Huawei/Honor.","id_12_20":"Solitamente Huawei ha problemi nella gestione dei processi in background e spesso questo porta alla chiusura forzata delle app che lavorano in background. Per risolvere il problema segui questi passaggi:\nImpostazioni telefono > Batteria > Lancio app e poi seleziona per MUV l'opzione “gestione manuale” e assicurati che sia tutto abilitato.","id_12_21":"Perché spesso l'app smette di funzionare mentre è in background e sto registrando una tratta? Uso un telefono Android OnePlus.","id_12_22":"OnePlus ha recentemente introdotto uno dei più rigidi limiti legati al background sui dispositivi Android. Non solo gli utenti devono abilitare impostazioni extra per far in modo che le app funzionino correttamente, ma queste impostazioni spesso si resettano in modo casuale e quindi gli utenti sono costretti a riattivarle regolarmente. Per risolvere il problema segui questi passaggi: \nApri il menu multitasking di OnePlus, quindi seleziona l’icona in alto a destra di MUV, non appena la finestra si apre, seleziona l’opzione LOCK.","id_12_23":"Perché spesso l'app smette di funzionare mentre è in background e sto registrando una tratta? Uso un telefono Android Nokia.","id_12_24":"Nonostante la maggior parte dei problemi relativi all’arrestarsi delle app in background siano stati risolti a marzo del 2019, alcuni telefoni Nokia chiudono ancora forzatamente tutti i processi in background dopo 20 minuti se lo schermo è spento. Per risolvere questo problema, fai quanto segue:\n- Vai nelle impostazioni del telefono > App > Vedi tutte le app\n- Seleziona nell’angolo del menu in alto a destra > Mostra il sistema\n- Trova > Risparmio energetico dell’app nella lista, selezionalo e imposta Chiusura forzata. Rimarrà ferma per un po’, ma alla fine si riavvierà.","id_12_25":"Perché l'app, dopo avermi tracciato, non mi ha dato punti alla fine del percorso? Uso un iPhone.","id_12_26":"Questo problema può essere dovuto al non aver abilitato il tracciamento per “Movimento & Fitness”. Risolverlo è facile: \nVai su Impostazioni > Privacy > Movimento & Fitness, quindi abilita il “Monitoraggio dell'attività fisica” (se necessario) e fai lo stesso per MUV.","id_12_27":"Perché la mia tratta a piedi non è stata considerata valida?","id_12_28":"È abbastanza inusuale, prova a controllare se hai attivato i servizi di localizzazione, in particolare:\nVai su Impostazioni > Privacy > Servizi di localizzazione, scendi in basso per cercare MUV e poi seleziona l’app e scegli l’opzione “Mentre usi l’app” oppure “Sempre”.","id_12_29":"Perché la mia tratta in bici non è stata considerata valida?","id_12_30":"Il problema potrebbe essere causato dall’alta velocità raggiunta. In questo caso l’algoritmo di riconoscimento delle attività potrebbe averti considerato come se fossi su un veicolo anche se così non era. Per ricevere supporto aggiuntivo, ti preghiamo di mandarci un feedback dal tasto dedicato all'interno del feed di riepilogo della tratta.","id_12_31":"Perché la mia tratta coi mezzi pubblici non è stata considerata valida?","id_12_32":"Questo errore nel validare la tratta (a meno che tu non abbia imbrogliato) è dato dal fatto che le misurazioni dei punti GPS non hanno trovato corrispondenza con un itinerario nel database di trasporto pubblico OpenStreetMap che usiamo come riferimento. Ciò può essere dovuto a diversi motivi: mancanza di segnale o segnale GPS debole, scarsa accuratezza del GPS del telefono, errori dati da mancanza di linee o fermate in una certa città. Al momento, stiamo lavorando a un nuovo algoritmo che mira ad essere più veloce e preciso; nel frattempo, se vuoi aiutarci, segnala il viaggio dal tasto dedicato all’interno del feed di riepilogo del viaggio per permetterci di analizzare il tuo caso d’uso.","id_12_33":"Perché la mia tratta in car pooling non è stata considerata valida?","id_12_34":"","id_12_35":"Come mai ho ottenuto molti meno punti del solito facendo la stessa tratta?","id_12_36":"Ci sono due ragioni principali:\n1. Gli spostamenti MUV sono validati segmento per segmento e poi, quando premi STOP, con un processo di validazione finale. Se durante questo controlla finale vengono riscontrate imprecisioni o dati in conflitto, alcuni tratti potrebbero non essere considerati validi e quindi ridurre il numero totale di punti assegnati per la tratta.\n2. Ogni utente ha un certo numero di km ideali da coprire in un modo sostenibile ogni giorno per ogni modalità di spostamento. Quando questa soglia viene raggiunta,l'algoritmo di attribuzione dei punti cambia, diventando meno premiante.

Al presionar el botón PLAY y elegiendo tu método de movimiento preferido (a pie, en bicicleta, en transporte público o en coche compartido), activarás el seguimiento. Durante esta fase, ganarás puntos en función de la distancia recorrida y el medio de transporte elegido. Si has cambiado tu medio de transporte, al presionar el botón PAUSA puedes pasar a otro modo.","id_12_07":"¿Qué son exactamente los viajes frecuentes?","id_12_08":"Estos son las rutas que recorres diariamente o varios días a la semana, como la ruta casa-trabajo.

Yo uso un movíl Android Huawei / Honor.","id_12_20":"Por lo general Huawei tiene problemas para administrar procesos en segundo plano y, a menudo, esto lleva al cierre forzado de las aplicaciones que funcionan en segundo plano. Para resolver el problema, sigue estos pasos:\nAjustes > Batería > Inicio de aplicaciones y luego seleccione la opción 'gestionar manualmente\" para MUV y asegúrese de que todo esté habilitado.","id_12_21":"¿Por qué la aplicación a menudo deja de funcionar mientras está en segundo plano y estoy grabando una ruta? Yo uso un movíl Android OnePlus.","id_12_22":"OnePlus se ha introducido recientemente una de las más rígidas limitaciones sobre  relacionadas al segundo plano en los dispositivos Android. Los usuarios no solo necesitan habilitar configuraciones adicionales para que las aplicaciones funcionen correctamente, sino que estas configuraciones a menudo se restablecen al azar y, por lo tanto, los usuarios se ven obligados a volver a habilitarlas regularmente. Para resolver el problema, sigue estos pasos:\nabre el menú multitarea OnePlus, luego selecciona el icono en la parte superior derecha de MUV, tan pronto como se abra la ventana, selecciona la opción BLOQUEAR.","id_12_23":"¿Por qué la aplicación a menudo deja de funcionar mientras está en segundo plano y estoy grabando una ruta? Yo uso un movíl Nokia Android.","id_12_24":"Aunque la mayoría de los problemas con los bloqueos de aplicaciones en segundo plano se resolvieron en marzo de 2019, algunos movíles Nokia aún cierran forzosamente todos los procesos en segundo plano después de 20 minutos si la pantalla está apagada. Para solucionar este problema, haz esto: - Ve a Adjustes > Aplicaciones > Todas las aplicaciones\n- Selecciona en la esquina superior derecha del menú > Mostrar procesos del sistema\n- Búsqueda > Ahorro de energía de la aplicacción en la lista, selecciónalo y configura Cierre forzado. Se quedará quieto por un tiempo, pero al final se reiniciará.","id_12_25":"¿Por qué la aplicación, después de seguirme, no me ha dado puntos al final de la ruta? Yo uso un movíl iPhone.","id_12_26":"'Este problema puede deberse a que no se haya habilitado el seguimiento para \" Actividad Física\". Resolverlo es fácil:\nVe a Ajustes > Privacidad > Actividad Física, luego activa \"Seguimiento deportivo (si es necesario) y haz lo mismo para MUV \".","id_12_27":"¿Por qué mi ruta a pie no se consideró válida?","id_12_28":"Es bastante inusual, intenta verificar si has activado los servicios de ubicación, en particular:\nVe a Ajustes > Privacidad > Localización, baja para buscar MUV y luego selecciona la aplicación y elige la opción 'Cuando se use la app\" o \"Siempre\".","id_12_29":"¿Por qué mi ruta en bicicleta no se consideró válida?","id_12_30":"El problema podría ser causado por el alta velocidad alcanzada. En este caso, el algoritmo de reconocimiento de las actividades puede haberlo considerado como si estuvieras en un vehículo, incluso si no fuera así. Para recibir soporte adicional, por favor envíanos un comentario desde el botón dedicado, dentro del resumen de ruta.","id_12_31":"¿Por qué mi ruta en el transporte público no se consideró válida?","id_12_32":"Este error al validar la ruta (salvo que tu no hayas hecho trampa/ no nos hayas engañado) se debe al que las medidas de los puntos GPS no coincidían con una ruta en la base de datos de transporte público OpenStreetMap que utilizamos como referencia. Esto puede deberse a varias razones: falta de señal o señal débil de GPS, poca precisión de GPS del movíl, errores ocasionados por falta de líneas o paradas en una determinada ciudad. En este momento, estamos trabajando en un nuevo algoritmo que pretende ser más rápido y más preciso; Mientras tanto, si deseas ayudarnos, informanos de la ruta desde el botón dedicado dentro del feed de resumen del la ruta para permitirnos analizar tu caso de uso.","id_12_33":"¿Por qué la ruta en coche compartido no se consideró válida?","id_12_34":"","id_12_35":"¿Por que he conseguido muchos menos puntos de lo que obtengo cuando hago la misma ruta?","id_12_36":"Hay dos razones principales:\n1. Los movimientos MUV se validan segmento por segmento y luego, cuando presionas STOP, con un proceso de validación final. Si se encuentran imprecisiones o datos conflictivos durante esta verificación final, algunas secciones pueden no considerarse válidas y, por lo tanto, se reduce el número total de puntos asignados para la ruta.\n2. Cada usuario todos los días tiene un cierto número de kilómetros ideales para cubrir rutas de manera sostenible, para cada modalidad de viaje. Cuando se alcanza este umbral, el algoritmo de atribución de puntos cambia y se vuelve menos gratificante. Si ya has realizado varios viajes hoy, es posible que ya hayas alcanzado este umbral .","id_12_37":"¿Por qué mi ruta casa-trabajo no se reconoce como tal?","id_12_38":"Si la ruta se ha validado pero no se ha marcado como casa-trabajo, probablemente es debido a uno de los siguientes motivos:\n1. Presionaste PLAY cuando ya estabas demasiado lejos de tu casa o trabajo.\n2. Presionaste STOP cuando aún no estabas suficientemente cerca del trabajo o de tu casa.\n3. Cometiste imprecisiones cuando cargaste tu ruta de rutina casa-trabajo\nEn el último caso, puedes ir a la sección 'Rutas frecuentes\" del menú lateral y cambiar los puntos de inicio y llegada de tu ruta frecuente.","id_12_39":"Preguntas principales","id_12_40":"Características generales de MUV","id_12_41":"Dinámica de juego de MUV","id_12_42":"Resolución de problemas comunes","id_12_43":"Preguntas frecuentes","id_12_44":"Como podemos ayudarte?","id_12_45":"Discover more about MUV through our tutorials","id_13_03":"Datos personales","id_13_04":"Completa tu perfil.","id_13_05":"Cuenta","id_13_06":"Cambia tu contraseña y actualiza tus opciones relacionadas con el GDPR.","id_13_07":"Notificaciones","id_13_08":"Habilita las notificaciones push para ser más competitivo.","id_13_09":"Idioma","id_13_10":"Cambiar el lenguaje MUV.","id_13_13":"Versión","id_13_14":"Fecha de nacimiento","id_13_15":"¡Nos gustaría saberlo, para poder desearle un feliz cumpleaños!","id_13_16":"Género","id_13_17":"Esto mejorará la precisión en el cálculo de calorías.","id_13_18":"Altura","id_13_19":"Peso","id_13_20":"Hombre","id_13_21":"Mujer","id_13_22":"Prefiero no decirlo","id_13_23":"Confirma","id_13_24":"Cambiar la contraseña","id_13_25":"La prudencia nunca es demasiado.","id_13_26":"Consentimiento informado","id_13_27":"Es decir, todas las cosas sobre el GDPR.","id_13_28":"Eliminar tu perfil","id_13_29":"¿Por qué querrías hacerlo?","id_13_30":"Contraseña actual","id_13_31":"Nueva contraseña","id_13_32":"Confirma contraseña","id_13_33":"Ojalá sea solo un hasta pronto","id_13_34":"¿Estás seguro de que deseas eliminar tu perfil?","id_13_35":"Esta acción es irreversible y se eliminarán todos tus datos.","id_13_36":"Sí, cancelame.","id_13_61":"Términos y condiciones","id_13_62":"Cómo funciona el servicio MUV.","id_13_63":"Política de privacidad","id_13_64":"Cómo gestionamos tus datos.","id_13_75":"Change nickname","id_13_76":"Edit your nickname checking it is available (and not offensive), then click Confirm.","id_13_77":"Give your avatar a new name.","id_13_37":"italiano","id_13_38":"inglés","id_13_65":"Español","id_13_66":"Portogués","id_13_39":"Cambiar idioma","id_13_40":"La aplicación se reiniciará.","id_13_41":"Inicio de la mañana","id_13_42":"¿Cansado de salir de casa y olvidarte de activar MUV?

Eu uso um telefone Huawei / Honor Android.","id_12_20":"Tradicionalmente, a Huawei tem um problema com o gerenciamento de processos de fundo e isso geralmente leva a assassinatos de aplicativos que trabalham em segundo plano. Para resolver o problema que você precisa seguir estas etapas:\nConfigurações do telefone> Bateria> Iniciamento do aplicativo e, em seguida, defina MUV para 'Gerenciar manualmente\" e verifique se tudo está ligado.","id_12_21":"Por que o aplicativo geralmente pára de funcionar enquanto está em segundo plano e estou rastreando uma viagem? Eu uso um telefone OnePlus Android.","id_12_22":"O OnePlus recentemente introduziu um dos limites de fundo mais severos em dispositivos Android. Não só os usuários precisam habilitar as configurações extras para fazer seus aplicativos funcionarem corretamente, mas essas configurações até são reiniciadas aleatoriamente para que os usuários sejam necessários para reativá-los regularmente. Para resolver o problema que você precisa seguir estas etapas:\nAbra o menu Multitarefa OnePlus e selecione o ícone no canto superior direito de MUV; Assim que a janela abrir, selecione a opção de bloqueio.","id_12_23":"Por que o aplicativo geralmente pára de funcionar enquanto está em segundo plano e estou rastreando uma viagem? Eu uso um telefone nokia android.","id_12_24":"Embora a maioria dos problemas relacionados a parada de aplicativos de fundo fosse resolvido em março de 2019, alguns telefones Nokia ainda matam qualquer processo de fundo após 20 minutos se a tela estiver desligada.\nPara corrigir este problema, por favor, faça o seguinte:\n- Vá para Configurações do telefone> Aplicativos> Veja todos os aplicativos\n- Toque no menu de canto superior direito> Mostrar sistema\n- Encontre> Aplicativo de poupança de energia na lista, selecione-o e Force Fechar.

Resolvendo é fácil:\nVá para Configurações> Privacidade> Motion & Fitness, depois ative o \"Rastreamento de fitness\" (se necessário) e faça o mesmo para o MUV.","id_12_27":"Por que minha viagem a pé não era considerada válida?","id_12_28":"Na verdade, é bastante incomum, tente verificar se você ativou os serviços de localização em particular:\nVá para Configurações> Privacidade> Serviços de Localização, rolar para baixo para encontrar MUV e, em seguida, toque no aplicativo e selecione a opção 'enquanto estiver usando o aplicativo\" ou \"sempre\".","id_12_29":"Por que minha viagem foi de bicicleta não considerada válida?","id_12_30":"O problema pode ser devido à alta velocidade que você alcançou. Neste caso, o algoritmo de reconhecimento de atividades pode ter considerado você como 'no veículo\" mesmo que você não fosse. Para receber suporte adicional, envie-nos feedback do botão dedicado dentro do cartão de feed de resumo da viagem.","id_12_31":"Por que minha viagem em transporte público não considerou válida?","id_12_32":"O erro na validação da viagem (a menos que você trapaceado) seja devido ao fato de que as medições do ponto de GPS não encontraram uma partida com uma viagem no banco de dados de transporte público OpenTreetMap que usamos como referência. Isso pode ser devido a várias razões: falta de cobertura ou sinal de GPS fraco, má precisão do GPS do telefone, erros devido à falta de linhas ou paradas em uma determinada cidade. No momento, estamos trabalhando em um novo algoritmo que visa ser mais rápido e preciso; Enquanto isso, se você quiser nos ajudar, denuncie a viagem do botão dedicado dentro do cartão de alimentação de resumo da viagem para nos permitir analisar seu caso de uso.","id_12_33":"Por que minha viagem de carpooling não era considerada válida?","id_12_34":"","id_12_35":"Como fiquei muito menos pontos do que costumo obter quando faço a mesma viagem?","id_12_36":"Existem duas razões principais para isso:\n1. Os viagens de MUV são segmentos validados por segmento e, em seguida, quando você pressiona parar, com um processo final de validação. Se encontrar imprecisões ou dados conflitantes, pode não considerar alguns segmentos válidos e, assim, reduzir o número total de pontos concedidos para a viagem.\n2. Cada usuário tem um certo número de kms ideais para cobrir de forma sustentável todos os dias para cada modo de trânsito. Quando este limiar é atingido, o algoritmo de conversão de pontos se torna menos gratificante. Se você já fez várias viagens hoje, é possível que você já tenha atingido esse nível.","id_12_37":"Por que minha viagem de casa para o trabalho não era reconhecida como uma frequente?","id_12_38":"Se a viagem for validada, mas não marcada como trabalho em casa, isso provavelmente deve ser devido a uma das seguintes razões:\n1. Você pressionou o jogo quando estivesse muito longe de casa ou trabalhando.\n2. Você pressionou parar quando você ainda não estava perto o suficiente para trabalhar ou para casa.\n3. Você fez imprecisões quando você carregou sua viagem de trabalho em casa rotineira.\nNo último caso, você pode ir para a seção 'Viagens frequentes\" do menu lateral e, eventualmente, editar o ponto inicial e final da sua viagem frequente.","id_12_39":"As principais perguntas","id_12_40":"Muv General Características.","id_12_41":"Dinâmica do jogo Muv.","id_12_42":"Resolvendo problemas comuns","id_12_43":"FAQ e tutoriais.","id_12_44":"Como podemos te ajudar?","id_12_45":"Discover more about MUV through our tutorials","id_13_03":"Dados pessoais","id_13_04":"Complete seu perfil.","id_13_05":"Conta","id_13_06":"Altere suas opções de apelido, senha ou gdrpr.","id_13_07":"Notificações","id_13_08":"Ativar notificações push para ser mais competitivo.","id_13_09":"Língua","id_13_10":"Altere a linguagem muv.","id_13_13":"Versão","id_13_14":"Data de nascimento","id_13_15":"Então podemos desejar-lhe um feliz aniversário!","id_13_16":"Gênero","id_13_17":"Isso melhorará a precisão na calculista de calorias.","id_13_18":"Altura","id_13_19":"Peso","id_13_20":"Masculino","id_13_21":"Fêmea","id_13_22":"Prefiro não dizer","id_13_23":"confirme","id_13_24":"Mudar senha","id_13_25":"A segurança nunca é alta demais.","id_13_26":"Consentimento informado","id_13_27":"Aka todas as coisas do GDPR.","id_13_28":"Exclua seu perfil","id_13_29":"Por que você gostaria de fazer isso?","id_13_30":"Senha atual","id_13_31":"Nova Senha","id_13_32":"Confirme a Senha","id_13_33":"Esperamos que seja apenas um adeus","id_13_34":"Tem certeza de que deseja excluir seu perfil?","id_13_35":"A ação é irreversível e todos os seus dados serão removidos.","id_13_36":"Sim, exclua-me.","id_13_61":"Termos e Condições","id_13_62":"Como funciona o serviço MUV.","id_13_63":"Política de Privacidade","id_13_64":"Como lidamos com seus dados.","id_13_75":"Change nickname","id_13_76":"Edit your nickname checking it is available (and not offensive), then click Confirm.","id_13_77":"Give your avatar a new name.","id_13_37":"italiano","id_13_38":"inglês","id_13_65":"espanhol","id_13_66":"Portóguese.","id_13_39":"Mudar idioma","id_13_40":"O aplicativo será reiniciado.","id_13_41":"Início da manhã","id_13_42":"Cansado de sair e esquecer de começar muv?
